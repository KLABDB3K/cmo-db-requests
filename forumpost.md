We are extremely excited to introduce a new system for handling DB requests!

From now on, we'd like to ask everyone to post their DB requests in the new [public issue tracker](https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests). This replaces the old DB request threads.

If you're not familiar with GitHub, don't worry. We've provided guidance that should help you get started, and will continue to update those materials as questions come in.

## Why Move to GitHub?
As a rule of thumb, if a team is spending more time wrestling with their systems than working...it's probably time to replace the systems.

The DB threads were especially problematic because they required each request to be manually copied into our internal trackers. This obviously ate up large chunks of time. 

Worse, with no way to guide submissions, we found a large number of the requests we were spending so much time to copy, sort, and triage were lacking critical information. In fact, of the 2,500 "open" issues clamoring for attention in our internal tracker, we estimated that less than 1/3 were actionable. And because we were tracking issues off-site, we had no way of following up with clarifying questions -- or even to let reporters know when their requests had been handled.

We wanted to do better.

At first (inspired partly by [this post](https://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=5124696)) we considered several forum-based solutions. However, we determined that merely expanding the forums would not address our biggest problems with the legacy system.

GitHub offered an alternative with numerous advantages:

* It was a platform we were already using
* We could easily coordinate across our internal and public trackers (no more manual copying!)
* We could create "issue forms" and templates to guide submissions
* We could use labels and milestones to categorize and prioritize work
* We could automate labelling (and more!) to handle basic sorting, triage, etc.
* Requests were "threaded," letting us communicate directly with reporters per-issue
* People could easily track the status of their requests (or any issue they were interested in)
* Community members could contribute to others' requests with comments, research, etc.

GitHub's focus on open-source development also offered some tantalizing possibilities for community collaboration. For example, the ongoing [Review and Editing of Unit Descriptions](https://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=5080875) could be handled as a branch on this (or a separate) repository, allowing users to make additions and edits before submitting a pull request for review by the project managers. But that's getting ahead of things!

## In Conclusion
Changing long-running systems -- even flawed ones -- is disruptive and can be controversial. We hope you can see why we feel the advantages we stand to gain outweigh any short-term disruption.

Although we don't see ourselves ever returning to the old method, this replacement should still be considered a beta program. There will inevitably be growing pains. We'd welcome any feedback, and ask for your patience as we make changes accordingly.

We look forward to your contributions on the new tracker!
