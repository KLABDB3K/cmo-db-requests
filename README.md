# CMO DB Development (Public)
Welcome to the public issue tracker for *Command: Modern Operations*.

This is an issue-only repository intended as a replacement for the old "DB Request Threads" on the Matrix Games Forums.

You can read more about why we opted to move to GitHub in [this post]().

## What Is This, And How Does It Work?
If you are familiar with the aforementioned "DB Request Threads," then the idea behind this repo should be familiar to you. Moving to GitHub brings numerous improvements to the process, but the basic concept is the same.

If you're not a veteran of the old threads, the idea is simple: anyone wishing for changes to the DB -- unit additions, updates to existing units, bug fixes, etc. -- can post their request here, where it will be triaged, sorted, and (eventually) handled by members of the DB team.

Please note **this is one of two trackers used by the DB team**, the other being a private/internal tracker for "hipri" tickets (such as Pro client requests). Moreover, **handling tickets -- in either tracker -- is only one part of our DB workflow**. We also do weekly "news roundups," in-depth national reviews, and exhaustive platform "deep dives." Dev activity on this public tracker will wax and wane based on our priorities; moreover, tickets will often be handled out-of-order. 

We promise there's a method to the madness. While it can be frustrating to see your carefully-researched ticket languishing -- and all the DB team members have been there, so we know how it feels -- remember everyone is working towards the same goal: a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date database.

## How Do I Contribute?
Anybody interested in supporting development of the *Command* DB is welcome to contribute. You do not need a history of development or of GitHub contributions, nor to be an experienced *Command* player. In fact, you don't even need to own *Command*.

Because no code is stored on this repo, traditional source control functions such as branches/forks, pull requests, etc. are irrelevant.

Instead, collaborators should use the "Issues" feature to file requests for updates and additions to the DB.

To submit a new issue is simple:

1. Navigate to the repository's "Issues" section. To link to that section specifically (such as if you want to bookmark the page), use:
https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests/issues
2. Click the "New Issue" button, and select the most appropriate template for your issue.
3. Provide as much information as you can, and then submit the issue.

Certain labels, user assignments, etc. may be assigned by default. While it is possible to add extra labels, milestones, etc. during issue submission, please refrain from doing so unless you are sure they are appropriate.

## Contact & Questions

Contributors are encouraged to post any questions regarding this repository on the [Discussions page](https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-dev/discussions). 

This does not replace the Matrix Games Forums and should not be used for general game discussion. However, GitHub Discussions offers an easy way to discuss DB development in the relevant space.
