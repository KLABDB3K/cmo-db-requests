# CMO DB Development (Public)
Welcome to the public request/issue tracker for the *Command: Modern Operations* database.

This is an issue-only repository intended to replace the old "DB Request Threads" on the Matrix Games Forums.

You can read more about why we opted to move to GitHub in [this post](https://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=5144985).

## What Is This, And How Does It Work?
Anyone wishing for changes to the DB can post their request here.

Please note **this is one of two trackers used by the DB team**. (The other is private/internal.) Moreover, **handling tickets is only one part of our DB workflow**. Dev activity on this tracker will wax and wane as priorities shift; tickets will often be handled out-of-order in support of larger objectives.

While it can be frustrating to see your carefully-researched ticket languishing while others are handled out-of-turn, remember everyone is working towards the same goal: a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date database.

## How Do I Contribute?
Anybody interested in supporting development of the *Command* DB is welcome to contribute. You do not need development experience, knowledge of code/databases, or even to own *Command*.

We recommend aspiring contributors first visit the [Discussions page](https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests/discussions) and review the [FAQs](https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests/discussions/4).

When you're ready to submit your first issue:

1. Navigate to the ["Issues" page](https://github.com/PygmalionOfCyprus/cmo-db-requests/issues).
2. Click the "New Issue" button and select a template. If necessary, you can open a blank issue.
3. Provide as much information as you can.
4. Submit the issue.

If you don't have a request in mind but still want to help, try sorting issues by the "help wanted" label!

As this is an issue-only repository, contributors do not need to use forks, pull requests, etc.
