        Thank you for taking the time to submit a new ship request!

        ### On Class Requests
        If you're requesting an entire class of ship rather than a specific vessel, please fill out the form as if for the class nameship. For example, if requesting the Arleigh Burke-class, fill out the form as if for DDG-51.

        If the class saw significant changes/blocks/flights/etc., it may be worth filing separate requests to cover these differences. Please fill out the follow-on forms as if for the block/flight nameship. For example, if requesting a Flight II Arleigh Burke-class, fill out the form as if for DDG-72.

        ### On Multinational Vessels
        Be cautious filing single requests for ships in the service of multiple multiple countries. Most ships are sold with different fittings or refit on transfer to different countries; these changes often warrant separate requests.

        ### ...Okay, how much of this do I *really* need to fill out?
        Although only some of these fields are "required," please do your best to supply as much information as possible. What you don't give us, we need to hunt down ourselves or estimate.

        If you can't (or don't want) to provide this information, consider whether filing a DB request will be helpful.

        ## Basic Information
        Please provide some basic information on the ship. 
        
        This is used to determine how the ship appears in-sim and in the DB viewer.

      label: Hypothetical
      description: Is this a hypothetical vessel, i.e. one not yet or never placed in service?

        When was the *class* in service?
        
        If requesting a specific vessel, this will match the vessel's service dates. If requesting a class (and therefore modelling a nameship), the out-of-service date may be much later than the nameship's decommissioning.
