        Thank you for taking the time to request a new satellite!

        Although only some of these fields are "required," please do your best to supply as much information as possible. What you don't give us, we need to hunt down ourselves or estimate.

        If you can't (or don't want) to provide this information, consider whether filing a DB request will be helpful.
